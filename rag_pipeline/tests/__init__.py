Unit tests for RAG Pipeline.

This test suite provides examples of testing patterns for core functionality.
In a production setting, this would be expanded to include:
- Edge case testing
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
- Error condition testing
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies

Current coverage focuses on:
- Configuration loading and path resolution
- Chunking strategies with known inputs
- Evaluation metric calculations
- Core utility functions
